# Crises, Public Debt & Interest Rates 1995-2020.
Our visualization project focuses on the analysis of the relationship between economic depressions, public debt and interbank interest rates in Mexico. Our data goes from 1985 up to 2020, paying particular attention to the multiple crises occurred during that period. In order to do so, we use the interbank interest rate for 91 days and the internal public debt for the period of 1995 up to 2020.
