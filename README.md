# Crisis, Public Debt & Interest Rates 1985-2020.
Our visualization project focuses on the analysis of the relationship between economic depressions, public debt expenditure and interbank interest rates in Mexico. Our data goes from 1985 up to 2020, paying particular attention to the multiple crises occurred during that period. In order to do so, we use the interbank interest rate for 91 days and the internal public debt of that period. We also use a time series analysis to plot the most significant lag in interest rate as the main external variable (x-axis).
